| **Human activity recognition using CNN+LSTM**  | This project implements a real-time Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using advanced deep learning techniques. The system employs a Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN) model to accurately classify various human activities from video inputs captured via a webcam. The user interface is built using Streamlit, enabling a seamless web-based interaction. | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com) | https://github.com/thomasantony12/Human-Activity-Recognition/tree/main |
| **Music genre classification using CNN**  | This project aims to classify music genres using spectrogram images generated from audio files. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn features from the spectrogram images and predict the genre of the music. | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com) | https://github.com/thomasantony12/Music-genre-classification-using-cnn |
